# Tutorial: Reduced Surrogates for the 2D Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion equations

The two-dimensional Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion equations model two chemical species `U` and `V`, which react according to `U + 2V` --> `3V` and `V`--> `P`. The reactions are irreversible, so P is an inert product . The system is modelled by a set of partial differential equations for the local non-dimensional concentrations of `U` and `V`, denoted by `u(x, y, t)` and `v(x, y, t)`, both of which are in [0,1]. The **macroscopic** governing equations are

The overline above `u` and `v` denotes the fact that this is a macroscopic variable, defined in this tutorial as the part of `u` and `v` which can be resolved on a spatial grid of `128x128` points. The `G_u` and `G_v` are subgrid-scale terms, meant to take the effect of unresolved scale into account.
